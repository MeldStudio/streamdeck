## Overview

Meld Studio 💙 Stream Deck. Take your stream to new heights with powerful new capabilities at your fingertips. Trigger transitions, manage audio tracks, toggle filter effects on and off, and much more. 

1. **Now you see me, now you don’t**: Things getting weird on the cat-cam? Quickly toggle visibility on any layer.
2. **What the \*\*\*\*\*?** Mute your microphone in a millisecond or precision adjust your audio inputs using the StreamDeck+.
4. **End your 24 hour streamathon with a bang.** Or just press the button to go offline.
5. **Want to post your victorious boss battle (and not the 13 times you died trying)?** Start and stop recordings or take a screenshot with the touch of a button - as many as you want.

And we're not done yet! We are continually working to bring you even more capabilities for this integration, so stay tuned for updates and new features.
